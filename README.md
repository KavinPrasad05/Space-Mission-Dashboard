# Space Mission Analysis Dashboard
## Overview
This repository houses a Power BI dashboard that provides a comprehensive analysis of space missions. The dashboard is designed to offer insights into key metrics such as total missions, countries involved, companies, launch sites, rockets, and associated costs.

## Features
### 1.Card Visuals for Essential Metrics:
Utilized card visuals to prominently display crucial metrics, including total missions, countries involved, companies, launch sites, rockets, and associated costs.

### 2.Area Chart for Historical Context:

Implemented an area chart spanning the years from the 1980s to 2020s, revealing a transformative shift in space activities. The visualization highlights 2016 as the onset of a new era following a slowdown in the 1980s.

### 3.Top 5 Country Analysis:

Developed insightful visualizations comparing the performance of the top 5 countries (USA, Russia, Kazakhstan, China, and France) in terms of launch numbers and overall costs. The area chart specifically illustrates mission trends for each of these leading countries.

### 4.Donut Chart for Mission Success Rates:

Implemented a donut chart to represent the success rates of missions for the top 5 countries. Notably, France emerges as the leader in mission success rates.
